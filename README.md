# Laravel Application Setup and Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Laravel application locally on your machine. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

-   PHP (>= 7.4)
-   Composer
-   MySQL or another supported database
-   Node.js and npm (for asset compilation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. Install Composer dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Generate an application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and any other necessary configurations.

## Database Setup

1.  Create a new database for your application.

2.  Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

3.  (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

        ```bash
        php artisan db:seed --class=ClassName
        ```

    \*notes: you can find the class on the ./database/seeders

## Running the Application

To start the Laravel development server, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Compiling Assets

If your application includes frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS), you may need to compile them using Laravel Mix. Run the following command to compile assets:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Additional Configuration

Refer to the Laravel documentation for more advanced configuration options and deployment strategies.
